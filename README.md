# JImageEmbedder
Command line utility for generating Base 64 representation of small image files for embedding small images directly in a webpage. Implemented as a simple command line wrapper of Java's Base64.Encoder class. Utility will either simply generate base64 encoding from an image file, or can also be used to generate the img tag needed for embedding in a webpage.
